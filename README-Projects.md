## 🚀 #5 - Mythical Man Year in One Day: AI-Accelerated Site Migrations

**Description**: An ambitious initiative demonstrating the power of AI-assisted development to compress traditional timelines dramatically. Inspired by Fred Brooks' classic "The Mythical Man-Month," this project inverts the paradigm—proving that with AI orchestration and modern tooling, one developer can accomplish what traditionally requires teams and months. These site migrations represent components of a larger effort to deliver one man-year of development work in a single day.

**Philosophy**: Traditional software development assumes linear scaling—adding developers adds capacity. AI-assisted development breaks this model, allowing individual developers to leverage intelligent tools for exponential productivity gains. This project validates that thesis through rapid, production-quality deliverables.

**Combined Technical Achievement**: Two complete websites designed, developed, and migrated from Wix.com to Vercel in under 4 hours total, showcasing AI-accelerated full-stack development at scale.
